    "The [Proteus toolkit](http://proteus.usace.army.mil) is a modeling package for the numerical simulation of continuous processes such as the shallow water wave equations.  Proteus was designed to run in traditional HPC environments, using the MPI libraries for efficient inter-node communication.  The [IPython project](http://ipython.org) provides tools for interactive computing that include a web-based interface called the IPython Notebook and a set of high-level libraries for parallel computing that complement MPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will construct a simulation with Proteus that will run in any traditional HPC environment and will monitor its evolution interactively from the web notebook, using the notebook's facilities for data visualization.  The interactive monitoring will be performed without stopping or slowing down the parallel simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be accomplished without requiring any changes to the architecture of Proteus and only a trivial, minimal change to how the code would have been executed in batch mode.  Importantly, this change does not introduce an IPython dependency into the simulation and has no discernible performance impact. This allows for the same code to be used in production runs absent interactive monitoring."

    "Here we create a numerical simulation object, `ns`, that we will use to compute the desired solution.  The key idea for performing interactive monitoring of an ongoing MPI simulation is to call the main solution method (in this case `ns.calculateSolution(...)`) in a *secondary worker thread*, leaving the main thread available to answer for IPython requests.  This separation allows all computation and MPI communications to happen in one thread, while the other is available for communication with an interactive control client (typically, but not necessarily, a human inspecting the results).  While we have chosen to put the IPython code in the main thread and the MPI code in the secondary one, these roles can be reveresed without ill effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where the numerical code has manual control of the time-stepping, one can very easily write a small helper class that advances the simulation step by step from the thread.  Such a configuration will then permit not only monitorig and inspection, but also pausing and restarting of the simulation (even with adjustment of parameters).  But for now, the following simple code suffices that uses the default `Thread` class without modifications.\n",

    "This report shows how IPython can be used to provide interactive introspection, monitoring and control capabilities to existing Python HPC codes that use MPI, requiring only trivial and non-intrusive modifications to the codes that don't introduce any permanent IPython dependency.  We have illustrated this by monitoring a shallow water simulation performed with the Proteus toolkit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only assumption made was that the HPC code has a \"doit\" method or function that runs the main body of the code.  If the code has fine-grained time-stepping control, we can use IPython to manually move the time step forward, pause and restart the simulation, and modify intermediate variables.  But even if only a global \"do it all\" capability exists, we can still introspect and monitor the simulation's evolution, visualizing intermediate results as they are generated in the HPC nodes but using our local visualization capabilities.  This allows for human analysis of the simulation as the process is ongoing, without having to add visualization support to the main code or having to slow down the simulation for interactive introspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know of no other system that provides interactive monitoring and visualization of a traditional MPI code with such low development effort, changes to the existing code and performance impact."
